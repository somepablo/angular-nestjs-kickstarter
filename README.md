# angular-nestjs-kickstarter

## Description

This is a minimal web-app boilerplate project using <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a> for the frontend and <a href="https://nestjs.com" target="_blank">NestJS</a> for the backend.

It contains the minimum dependencies (does not include tests, lint, or code coverage tools) for setting up a web-app with client-server communication through a REST API.

The project contains a unique package.json file in order to manipulate, build and deploy both environments at once, which reduces an important amount of time switching between folders, terminals and so on.
